Project Summary:
Our project is a web application that provides a digital menu for restaurants. The web application allows restaurants to add their menu items, categories, and customize their restaurant brand. The system allows system administrators to manage restaurant subscriptions, and restaurant access permissions based on their subscription. The system uses a modern technology stack that includes Next.js for the frontend, Express.js for the backend, and Firebase for the database.

Functional Requirements:

Restaurant users can add, edit, and remove menu items. Each item has a name in different languages, pricing, and a description. The system also allows restaurant users to add images to the items.
Restaurant users can create categories for their menu items.
Restaurant users can customize their restaurant branding, including their restaurant name, logo, address, phone number, social media accounts, and location on a map.
System administrators can manage restaurant subscriptions, including free and professional subscriptions. Free subscriptions allow restaurants to create a menu with a limited number of 20 items, while professional subscriptions allow restaurants to add up to 300 items to their menu.
Restaurant access permissions are based on their subscription level, with professional subscribers having full access to all features while free subscribers are limited to menu item creation and editing.
The system allows for data analysis by capturing data such as dates and times of menu item additions, edits, and removals.
Technical Requirements:

The system uses a modern technology stack, including Next.js for the frontend and Express.js for the backend.
The system uses Firebase for the database, with data organized in a hierarchical structure that allows for easy querying and updating of menu items and categories.
The system is built using a modular approach, with each component of the system being built as a separate module or component. This makes the system easy to maintain, update, and scale.
The system is built according to the principles of the 12 Factor App philosophy, including using a configuration management system and avoiding hard-coded values.
The system uses Test Driven Development (TDD) approach, which involves writing automated tests before writing code to ensure that the code is working as expected and to catch bugs early.
The system is designed to be scalable and to handle large volumes of traffic by using caching mechanisms, load balancing, and horizontal scaling techniques.
Code Structure:

Frontend:
    a. The frontend is built using Next.js, which is a React framework for building server-side rendered applications.
    b. The frontend is organized into modules, with each module representing a different component of the system.
    c. Each module has its own set of tests, which are run automatically as part of the continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
    d. The frontend uses API calls to communicate with the backend.
Backend:
    a. The backend is built using Express.js, which is a popular Node.js framework for building web applications.
    b. The backend is organized into modules, with each module representing a different component of the system.
    c. Each module has its own set of tests, which are run automatically as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
    d. The backend uses Firebase for the database, with data organized in a hierarchical structure that allows for easy querying and updating of menu items and categories.
CI/CD:
    a. The CI/CD pipeline is responsible for automatically building, testing, and deploying the system.
    b. The pipeline includes multiple stages, including linting, testing, building, and deploying.
    c. The pipeline is triggered automatically on each code commit, ensuring that the system is always up-to-date and working correctly."# sw"
